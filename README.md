The goal was to measure how many words the user can type in one minute and record the score. I also wanted to make it fun, but it's primarily an exercise. I web-scraped the common English words from www.espressoenglish.net. 

Some of the words came back from the scraper with punctuation at first, due to the layout of the page, so that took some tweaking. I wanted to keep my custom fonts in the app but it didn't seem feasible because bundling 
fonts in a Tkinter app is error-prone. In the end I had to settle for common fonts that everyone will have on their machine.

I enjoyed designing the start screen and orchestrating the interplay between the text input and the sequence of words. Making some atmospheric sounds, that wouldn't distract too much from the main purpose of the app, was 
a good experience. Lastly, I never knew there was a Sonic the hedgehog keyboard. 

There a lot of ways this app could improve, I think the main one would be by integrating local languages. Converting it to a format where I can use my own fonts would be better as well. There could also be various tiers of
difficulty where you come up against less common words.
